Write a function that takes in a non-empty string representing a valid
Unix-shell path and returns a shortened version of that path.

A path is a notation that represents the location of a file or directory in a
file system.

A path can be an absolute path, meaning that it starts at the root directory
in a file system, or a relative path, meaning that it starts at the current
directory in a file system.

In a Unix-like operating system, a path is bound by the following rules:
  
    1. The root directory is represented by a /. This means that if
    a path <i>starts</i> with /, it's an absolute path; if it
    doesn't, it's a relative path.

    2. The symbol / otherwise represents the directory separator.
    This means that the path /foo/bar is the location of the
    directory bar inside the directory foo, which is
    itself located inside the root directory.
  
    3. The symbol .. represents the parent directory. This means
    that accessing files or directories in /foo/bar/.. is
    equivalent to accessing files or directories in /foo.
  
    4. The symbol . represents the current directory. This means
    that accessing files or directories in /foo/bar/. is equivalent
    to accessing files or directories in /foo/bar.
  
    5. The symbols / and . can be repeated sequentially
    without consequence; the symbol .. cannot, however, because
    repeating it sequentially means going further up in parent directories. For
    example, /foo/bar/baz/././. and /foo/bar/baz are
    equivalent paths, but /foo/bar/baz/../../../ and
    /foo/bar/baz definitely aren't. The only exception is with the
    root directory: /../../.. and / are equivalent,
    because the root directory has no parent directory, which means that
    repeatedly accessing parent directories does nothing.

  Note that the shortened version of the path must be equivalent to the original
  path. In other words, it must point to the same file or directory as the
  original path.

Sample Input
path = "/foo/../test/../test/../foo//bar/./baz"

Sample Output
"/foo/bar/baz" // This path is equivalent to the input path.
