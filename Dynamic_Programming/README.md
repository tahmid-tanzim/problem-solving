# Dynamic Programming

### Bottom-Up Approach
Build solution based on one or more previous case
i.e. `return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)`

Tabulation


### Top-Down Approach
Recursion, Memoization


### Half-and-Half Approach
*Merge Sort* & *Binary Search* is Half-and-Half Approach 


### Longest Common Subsequence
    1. Largest Common Substring
    2. Print LCS
    3. Shortest Common Super sequence
    4. Print SCS
    5. Minimum number of insertion and deletion a~>b
    6. Largest repeating subsequence
    7. length of largest subsequence of a which is A substring in B
    8. subsequence pattern matching
    9. Count how many times A appears as subsequence in B
    10. Largest palindromic subsequence
    11. Largest Palindromic Substring
    12. Count of Palindromic Substring
    13. Min number of deletions in a string to make it a palindrome
    14. Min number of insertion in a string to make it a palindrome
