# Currency Conversion

### Problem
Neo is looking to find the best currency conversion possible for our customers.
However, we donâ€™t have direct Canadian Dollar conversions to all currencies
So we have to trade currencies for other currencies.
It is possible that we can go from one currency to another, and that a currency could show up multiple times.

#### Example
```shell
Convert CAD to EUR
CAD -> GBP -> EUR
```

There are no cycles
```shell
CAD -> EUR -> GBP -> EUR
```

Utilizing the API data, return the best possible conversion rate for every currency we can get,
assuming we start with $100 CAD. The best possible conversion rate should yield the highest possible
amount of currency that you are converting to.
Given the following example, the longer route yields the higher amount (95.00) and
is therefore the best conversation rate.

```shell
CAD -> HKD = 90.00
CAD -> GBP -> DOGE -> HKD = 95.000
```

### Requirements
- Use one of the following languages: Javascript, Typescript, Java, C#, Python or Ruby
- Ensure you comment your code
- Use a REST call to get the data, do not hardcode it into your source code.
- Generate a CSV file as an output that contains optimal conversions from CAD to all currencies.
The file should have the following format:
 -- Currency Code (ie. AUD, USD, BTC)
 -- Country (ie. Australia, USA, Bitcoin)
 -- Amount of currency, given we started with $100 CAD (ie. 1500.43)
 -- Path for the best conversion rate, pipe delimited (ie. CAD | GBP | EUR)
 
 #### Output Format:
 `currency_code,currency_name,amount,conversion_path`
