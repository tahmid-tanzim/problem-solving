"""
  Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer n and
  returns the number of possible Binary Tree topologies that can be created with exactly n nodes.

  A Binary Tree topology is defined as any Binary Tree configuration,
  irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist only two Binary Tree
  topologies when n is equal to 2: a root node with a
  left node, and a root node with a right node.

  Note that when n is equal to 0, there's one topology that can be created: the None / null node.

Sample Input
n = 3

Sample Output
5
